The race of Gnats are one of the oldest races known to modern scholars, with
origins that can be traced back to the early days of the first era.

Gnat society is divided into a class structure with the common gnat, often
simply refered to as a 'gnat' being the lowest and most populated of these
classes. Above the common gnat, there is the gnot, considered the artisans
of Gnat culture. Further above the gnot is the gnat lord, which are few in
number and typically easily identifable by their elaborate hats, which common
gnats are forbidden from ever wearing. They are typically found of gold
encrusted bandanas, which are typically worn only in formal settings. Unlike
thei relationship between the gnots and the common gnats, which while the
former is higher in status than, they never have direct political sway over any
of the lesser-in-status gnats, at least none deriving from class strucutre.

The fbir is also a seperate class of Gnat society. They are usually considered
distinct from the common gnat to gnat lord totem pole, and from a foreigner's
perspective are typically classified as the 'priest' class. The fbR, the
pronunciation of which is often lost to foreigners, is often equated to be the
'high priests' of Gnat society, as they are often found to direct the more
common fbir in the direction of religious services.
